# CSTBox extension for Z-Wave devices support

This repository contains the code for the extension adding the support
for Z-Wave based devices in the [CSTBox framework](http://cstbox.cstb.fr). 

It works with the [Z-Way](http://www.z-wave.me/) controller and its association 
REST API server.

*IMPORTANT: it will not work with basic Z-Wave USB sticks.*

## Runtime dependencies

This extension requires the CSTBox core to be already installed.
